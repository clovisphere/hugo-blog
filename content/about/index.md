I'm Clovis (like the [first kings of Franks](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Clovis_I)), 
but everyone calls me Clov ~~or Cloclo~~, so stick to that! I am a [sofware tester](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29845/software-tester) by day, 
and a [developer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-software-developer-What-do-they-do) by night - in between, I try to play guitar 
and waste time on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) or [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/). 
I'm from [Congo/Kinshasa](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo) 
but I live and work in [Nairobi, Kenya](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nairobi).
