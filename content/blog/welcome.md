To whom it may concern,

I decided to start this blog out of fustration, but mainly because there's so many things I wanna say on other platforms - 
but I can't, thanks to the 130-160 characters limit (Hi, WhatsApp! Hi, Twitter!).

So here we are, my own space on the web. A place where I will rant ooooh yes, I will rant about anything and everything 
'cause heeeeeck life is too short.. if I die, at least, my words will survive:-)

**P.S** This blog will contain my personal views, thoughts on different topics, 
it's not set in stone, nor should you treat what I say/write as "biblical verse", I write for me (first), people reading my ish is an accident (thanks to the internet), 
so don't take things too seriously, especially on this blog - if you ain't happy with what I say or how I say it, please, go write your own, it's a free world, friend!


Yours truly,
