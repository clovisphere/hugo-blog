To whom it may concern,

I decided to start this blog out of fustration, but mainly because there's so many things I wanna say on other platforms - 
but I can't, thanks to the 130-160 characters limit (Hi, WhatsApp! Hi, Twitter).

So here we are, my own space on the web. A place where I will rant ooooh yes, I will rant about anything and everything 
'cause heeeeeck life is too short.. if I die, I still my words will survive:-)

**P.S** This blog will contain my personal views, thoughts on different topics, 
it's not set in stone, nor is it biblical verses, I write for me (first), people reading my ish is an accident (thanks to the internet), 
so don't take things too seriously - if you ain't happy about my ish, go write your own, it's a free world!
